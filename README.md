# Deep Learning Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of three notebooks, each tackling a different deep learning task: Emotion Classification from text, Automatic Speech Recognition, and Image Denoising & Super-Resolution.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

1.  [Emotion Classification (Text)](#1-emotion-classification)
2.  [Automatic Speech Recognition (Speech)](#2-automatic-speech-recognition)
3.  [Image Denoising & Super-Resolution (Vision)](#3-image-denoising--super-resolution)

### 1. Emotion Classification

* **Task:** Classify emotions from textual data.
* **Data:** A challenging, low-resource dataset featuring three linguistically diverse languages: Santhali, Kashmiri, and Manipuri.
* **Models & Techniques:**
    * Utilized the **Gemma-3-1B** model.
    * Employed **few-shot prompting** for training.
    * Fine-tuned the model using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**.

### 2. Automatic Speech Recognition

* **Task:** Transcribe speech to text.
* **Data:** 23 hours of Uyghur speech.
* **Process:**
    * Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify and handle large audio samples and silences.
    * Trained the **Whisper** model for transcription.

### 3. Image Denoising & Super-Resolution

* **Task:** Denoise noisy images and perform 4x super-resolution to significantly enhance clarity and resolution.
* **Models:**
    * Fine-tuned **MPRNet** (Multi-Stage Progressive Image Restoration Network) for denoising.
    * Fine-tuned **ESRGAN** (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) for 4x super-resolution.

##  How to Run the Notebooks

1.  Ensure you have completed the [Setup & Installation](#️-setup--installation) steps and have activated your virtual environment.

2.  Start the Jupyter Notebook server from your terminal:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3.  Once the server opens in your browser, click on one of the project notebooks to get started:
    * `EmotionClassification.ipynb` (or the actual filename)
    * `SpeechRecognition.ipynb` (or the actual filename)
    * `Denoising:SuperResolution.ipynb` (or the actual filename)
